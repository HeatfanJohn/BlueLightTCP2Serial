# BlueLightTCP2Serial

This project implements a TCP to serial port interface to take commands for a BlackBox Pow-R-Switch from a TCP port and output the commands over an RS232 Serial connection using a USB serial device.

This is primarily to allow a UNISYS Mainframe computer control warning lights in a operations control room.  The UNISYS Mainframe doesn't have direct access to serial RS232 ports.  This program will act as the transport medium.
